## Make the most of life

>“Life goes by in the blink of an eye.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

Life is not ours to possess, it is a precious gift that we are given. Some of us will be graced with a long life, others may have only a brief amount of time. There is nothing fair about this. But what is important is how we use the life we are given.

## Contemplate how to die

We are born into this world, then we die. Whenever you are confused about how to live, you should think about the brevity of human life.

## Accept reality for what it is

We cannot change what happens in life, but we can decide how to deal with what happens. It’s all about preparing yourself to accept whatever happens.

## Every day is a new day

> “Every day is new, and new again tomorrow.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

In the world of nature, every day is a new day. The preoccupations of today will end today. Tomorrow there will be a new you. So there is no need to worry.

## Wake up 15 minutes earlier

Waking up 15 minutes earlier, lengthen your spine, take slow breaths, enjoy a cup of tea/coffee, look at the sky, listen to the warbling of birds... It can liberate you from busyness.

## Be grateful for every day, even the most ordinary

>“All days are good days.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

Ordinary/unremarkable as it may seem, this is actually what makes it all the more amazing. The simple happiness is the passage of one day after another.

## Focus on the present rather than on the past

Whether good/bad things happen, each day is precious because it will never come about again. The goodness of every day is determined not by what happens/whom you meet, but by your own mind.

## Don’t think of unpleasant things right before bed

When you get into bed, let go of whatever happened to you since waking up that morning, be thankful for having made it through another day.

## Do not neglect your meals

>“Eat and drink with your whole heart.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

When you eat a meal, pause after every bite, focus only on eating that meal. All food passes through the hands of a hundred people before it reaches us. By adopting this mind-set, you will become aware of how fortunate you are.

## The benefits of a plant-based diet

>“Food serves not only the body but also the mind.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

When adopting a plant-based diet, your skin is clearer, your mind becomes peaceful. Eating only meat inspires a combative spirit, your skin starts to discolor. So try eating only vegetables one day a week.

## Try going barefoot

Go barefoot at home, wear thong sandals when you go out. This lifestyle naturally strengthens the body.

## Exhale deeply

When your breathing comes from your chest, you feel adrift. It breeds impatience, quicken.

Whenever you feel a rush of negative emotions(anger, anxiety,...). Slowly exhale a long, thin breath, inhalation naturally follows. You will start to feel calmer, more grounded, connected to the earth.

## Anxiety is intangible

Anxiety is the invention of your own mind. It’s a waste of time to get lost in a labyrinth of your own thoughts. Instead, direct your energies to the reality you’re facing & take one step at a time. You may be surprised by how easy it is to accomplish something/to come up with a solution.

## Make time to be alone

When trying to solve a problem, you don’t stop thinking about it for a moment; but you just keep plugging away at it.

Find a place where you can disconnect from other people, things. Spend time by yourself, try to clear your mind 10m/day. When you are not distracted by other things, your true self/true happiness/good idea can be revealed

## Sit zazen

Humans are not capable of thinking while moving. When our mind is focused on movement, it is difficult to engage in profound thought.

Try sitting zazen, empty your mind, allow your thoughts to float up then drift away. When sitting zazen, you enter an alpha state, with the brain waves associated with relaxation taking over.

## Speak loudly

When you speak loudly, you are able to hear your own voice clearly. It stimulates & activates your brain.

## Think simple

When you’re uncertain, simplicity is the best way to go. Focus your attention on just one thing; rather than branching out into this, that.

## Enjoy the inconvenience

Homemade food > fast food. But it requires more time, effort. Life also requires time, effort. So, when we eliminate time, effort; we eliminate life’s pleasures.

## Appreciate things you already have

There is a reason why you acquired things around you. Take good care of them, treat them like they are the best things.

Objects do not have merely one purpose. They can be used in myriad ways, depending upon the user’s imagination.

## Discard what you don’t need, acquire only what you need

>“Wanting more leads to suffering.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

When things aren’t going well, we should first part with something(attachments, assumptions, possessions…) before looking to acquire something else.

Give some thought to whether you really need it, look at what you already have before acquiring something new.

## Simplify your room

There is a connection between your mind & your physical space. Arrange your rooms sparsely. You will feel more clear headed; able to focus 100%, without distraction, on your work.

## Line up your shoes when you take them off

By cultivating this habit, everything about your life will be inexplicably sharper, more orderly.

## Try taking care of something

When you buy a tomato, it’s just another tomato to you. But a tomato that was grown with your own hands transcends being a simple “ingredient.” When we nurture something, we develop a mind that cares for things & feels affection for others.

## Notice changes

Maintain a regular lifestyle, so you can notice the slightest changes from a fixed point. You are able to see yourself as you really are & taking good care of your mind, body.

## Do not fear change

The world is constantly changing. Our selves, possessions, people who surround us, will always change. A supple mind accepts change, it finds new beauty, hope in it.

## Don’t fixate on right/wrong, good/bad

>“If you fuss over black and white, you miss out on the beauty of gray.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

Things don’t need to be defined as right/wrong, good/bad, likes/dislikes. A compromise may be the best way. These things are all products of our own mind. When you reach enlightenment, we can see  things for what they are, our predilections disappear.

## Don't label yourself

There is another you(freer, richer, more potential,...) within yourself. So don't label ourselves as “this/that kind of person”. Try
everything to awaken this other self of you.

## Don’t compare yourself to others

>“When you give up, your potential drops to zero.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

Some jobs may seem more glamorous from the outside than others. But what you see now is the cumulative result of steadily working away at ordinary tasks.

What might now seem useless can turn out to be auspicious. Not a single effort goes to waste when you work hard in the present moment. There is pleasure to be found in the repetition of work that suits you.

## Think with your own head

- Knowledge: things you learn in school/on your own.
- Wisdom: what you know from putting knowledge to use.

In today’s world, we’re constantly inundated with knowledge. But you need wisdom to help you decide how to go about your life. See/feel as much as you can, make sure to think with your own head.

## Do things by yourself

No matter how you try to explain the coolness/warmth of water, you cannot really know it without touching it. There are some things you
can appreciate only when you do them yourself.

## Don’t be a show-off

When people become wealthy/rise in status, they tend to become proud, boastful. But their true charisma might come across more naturally if they didn’t say a word.

## Free yourself from money

>“The more we are attached to money, the more it eludes our grasp.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

Instead of thinking about money, we should concern ourselves with our higher purposes(How can I contribute to society? What can I do to be useful in the world?...). By contemplating these questions & taking action,  the money you need will ultimately find you.

## Wait for the right time/opportunity

When work/relationships aren’t going well, throwing yourself into finding a solution is one possibility. But there are times when waiting for the right moment can be better.

## Demonstrate, rather than assert how you feel

Express how you feel, rather than spelling it out. When it comes to conveying your true intentions, actions > words.

## Take pleasure in your work

When we have something arduous to do, we often complain about it. With this attitude, it is very difficult to find joy in our work.

Whatever the situation you are facing, you never know what might become an opportunity to discover your true self.

Don't think of work as labor/burden, try to see it as a mindful work that will nurture/educate you.

## Simply immerse yourself

When we are at work, we often think, “How long until it’s time for a break?”/“This work is so boring.” But when we are on a day off, we often think about work. Try simply immersing yourself in what is before you. This allows you to focus on what needs to be done now, without worrying about all the other things in your life.

## Make distinctions between work & home

Your home is the 1st gate, the door of your car/the train is the 2nd gate, the door at your office is the 3rd gate.

When you cross the 3rd gate. Focus on your work & do your best.

When you are back at the 1st gate. Leave work behind, it's time to relax, enjoy your home life.

## Focus on others’ merits

Focus on others’ merits rather than their faults, you can create a beautiful relationship.

## Deepen your connection with someone

>“A person cannot live by his/her good graces alone.” ~ Shunmyō Masuno

What’s important is not the number of your connections but their depth. So concentrate on a single encounter, build a meaningful relationship.

## Give up the need to be liked by everyone

Being attached to the notion of getting along/being friends with someone, you will get caught up with not wanting to be disliked. This only creates tension.

## Pay no attention to other's words

Words are important, but it is more important not to be swayed by words. Do not be attached to words, relationships. Try putting it at a distance.

## Do not be swayed by the opinions of others

When it’s time to make the final adjustments, it’s best to do it alone. Decisiveness is about having the ability to trust in yourself.

## Consider what others say with empathy

People’s feelings cannot always be expressed in words. Some people may not have an easy time describing how they feel. We should not only listen to what others have to say, but also consider their feelings with empathy.

## Find the keys to life in the stories of older people

The stories older people have to tell about everything they’ve seen, experienced whether it’s successes/failures are invaluable. Unlike the knowledge that is to be found in books, school; this is firsthand experience.

## Find occasions to get together with family

We all want to hide our weaknesses, portray ourselves as better than we are. Only among family, we can let our real self be seen. The next time you visit them, take the time to sit, talk with them. Time spent with them can heal a weary mind, revitalize your heart.

## Get in touch with nature

If you notice a stone lying on the ground, pick it up, hold it. When you see flowers blooming by the side of the road, stop, smell their fragrance. It will relax you.

## Create a small garden on your balcony

Try creating a garden in your own home(yard, balcony, window ledge...) Within that space, representing the landscape of your mind. So that place can be where your mind can escape & look upon your essential self.
